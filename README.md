This project was created for translating media files (videos) to virtual surfaces

Program uses webcam as defualt source of capturing video and allow to choose video file from computer to translate

Captured webcam stream is showing on the main form in real time mode and detects ARUco labels on the stream, all types of ARUco labels of 6x6 dictionary could be recognized as virtual surfaces.
Chosen video from computer would be started when cam will recognize ARUco label on form. Virtual surfaces with media files on it could be shifted in any direction in any dimension (X,Y,Z).

In this project were used SharpGL, OpenCVSharp as main libraries. Programm was debugged and tested manually. This project was created in frame of study course Computer Vision.
It can be helpful in different ways such as computer vision recognition complexes.

To make story short: this project is the homemade version of Apple Vision Pro software :D
